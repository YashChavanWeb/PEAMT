## Frontend

The frontend is developed using React and Vite, providing a responsive and interactive user interface. It integrates with Firebase for authentication and data management.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/peamt.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd peamt/client
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install @reduxjs/toolkit firebase react react-dom react-dotenv react-redux react-router-dom redux-persist
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add your environment variables:**

   ```plaintext
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
   VITE_PRIVATE_DASHBOARD_ID=your_private_dashboard_id
   VITE_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=your_dashboard_password
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Usage

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to access the application. Ensure the backend server is running for a fully functional experience.

## Backend

The backend is constructed with Node.js and Express, offering a RESTful API, authentication, and data management capabilities.

### Setup

1. **Navigate to the root directory:**

   ```bash
   cd peamt
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install @reduxjs/toolkit axios bcryptjs body-parser cookie-parser cors dotenv express jsonwebtoken lenis mongoose nodemon react-redux three
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:**

   ```plaintext
   MONGO=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ADMIN=your_admin_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Usage

The backend server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default. Ensure that it is running to allow communication with the frontend.
